This program creates a PDF file out of a specifically formated Markdown file.
In particular, the markdown file can contain extra information that
will be included in the final PDF with a fancy header. See examples included.

Dependencies:
* A latex engine. `xelatex` should be in your `$PATH`.
* The `pandoc` executable should be in your `$PATH`.
* These two python libraries: `sh`, `pystache`.

You can use it from the shell like this:
$ pymarktex lorem.md
